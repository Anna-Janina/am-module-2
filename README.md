# portfolio-module-2

## Description

- My first website I ever created. We didn't receive a starter code this week so I had to create everything myself. To begin with I did take the code from the previous homework as a reference but once I started ending my own code it started to be a bit messy. In the end I don't think it was worth to copy the code. 

- How it works: If you click on About Me, Work and Contact Me it should take you to the left side bar. If you click on Resume Download you will be able to download my resume. Click on any of the 5 photos in the body and it will take you to my previous work.
